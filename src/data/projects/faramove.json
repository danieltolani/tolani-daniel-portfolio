To make it loop cleanly so it could be duplicated easily, a TrimPaths animation was applied to create a continuous cycling movement by animating the offset property.<br>After that, the extra parts (top, right and bottom) that formed the full rectangle were masked out, leaving a straight dashed line that loops smoothly.<br>For the ones pointers that had to go round the curve, I simply added a cc Bend it effect for when they approach the curves.",
