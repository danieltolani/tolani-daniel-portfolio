    "motion-text-block-2": "The goal here was to keep all three boxes unwrapped in a single composition so there was full control over the content, since this was the only scene that included feature listings. Using the Cinema 4D renderer in AE, once one box was built, the rest was simply duplicating it and adjusting each one to match the styleframe — this time in an actual 3D space.",
    "motion-text-block-3": "For the three strokes that follow each pointer on the logo, I wanted to avoid using motion blur. Staying consistent with the flat faux-3D style, motion blur felt out of place. Instead, I leaned into using dashed strokes as speed trails which sold the fast, snappy movement feel.",
    "motion-text-block-4": "The starting point was a simple rectangle shape with a stroke (no fill). Dashes and gaps were added to give it that broken-line motion. To make it loop cleanly so it could be duplicated easily, a TrimPaths animation was applied to create a continuous cycling movement by animating the offset property.<br>After that, the extra parts (top, right and bottom) that formed the full rectangle were masked out, leaving a straight dashed line that loops smoothly.<br>For the ones pointers that had to go round the curve, I simply added a cc Bend it effect for when they approach the curves.",

I chose a sound that felt deliberately unexpected—using a tom and snare to open an app video where clicks, bells, notifications, and swooshes are what you’d normally expect.",
