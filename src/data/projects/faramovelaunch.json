While going through mood-setters online, I came across an image of a laptop with sticky notes - around the same time Faramove had actually sent me a laptop, and I’d had a real fear of it breaking. That emotional tension became my anchor.",
                "Then  at the timme, I stumbled on a “It’s a gift” UI button from a course I purchased, and it clicked — I could merge both moments into a story about someone sending a cherished item as a gift… only for something to go wrong. That tension became the heartbeat of the concept.",
                "I pulled inspiration heavily from references during this stage. For exaample, Instead of showing a traditionally cracked screen, I created a pixel-style face that shifts from happy to sad at the moment of impact. This gave personality to the laptop without relying on clichés, inspired by a reference I had seen."
