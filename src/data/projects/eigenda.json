    "motion-text-block-2": "The goal here was to keep all three boxes unwrapped in a single composition so there was full control over the content, since this was the only scene that included feature listings. Using the Cinema 4D renderer in AE, once one box was built, the rest was simply duplicating it and adjusting each one to match the styleframe — this time in an actual 3D space."
