The palette is high-contrast and joyful purples, yellows, greens, and warm pastels—stacked in ways that feel lively but never chaotic. Across characters, posters, and abstract frames, the style maintains a sense of harmonious cacophony: busy, rhythmic, full of personality, yet always balanced and intentional.",

Sound design was handled by an expert (check credits for info), using the references, references; Tati’s playful soundscapes, Freddie Mercury’s theatricality, Beatles-level experimentation, and jazz’s messy charm. \n The direction built on these influences with a playful, rhythmic, slightly chaotic feel that still remained approachable. Small pops, bends, shuffles, and tonal surprises reinforced the motion’s spontaneity. The audio had to be bold enough to carry personality, but subtle enough to avoid feeling like a parody. The result was a blend of sound and motion that embodied Pinata’s optimistic, colorful, confident worldview — a brand that believes in what’s inside, and expresses it joyfully.",
