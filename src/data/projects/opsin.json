The layouts were built to highlight short, impactful lines, ensuring each felt deliberate without overwhelming the viewer.",

This led to a design approach that kept type large, clean and high-contrast. Long sentences were avoided, and each visual block was structured to give the eye enough breathing room to follow the narrative without pausing the video.",
                "Although the visuals had to feel dynamic, full 3D text wasn’t the right fit for the brand. Instead, the solution was to introduce subtle depth through layered blocks, shadow separation and light parallax. This approach created a sense of dimensionality while maintaining the brand’s flatter, refined visual identity. It kept the compositions sharp and modern without drifting into a different aesthetic language."
