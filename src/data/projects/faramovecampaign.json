                "The goal was to move away from showing too many UI elements, especially since new apps were popping up everywhere post-covid. But somehow - my early frames still included UI components and copy that referenced \"the app.\" This pushed me to create a strict 'DO NOT' list (a technique I learnt from reading 'DESIGN FOR MOTION' by Austin Shaw.",
                "One key rule was that no actual design components from the real product would appear in the teaser. I stuck to this fully, using only simple, recognizable elements like radio buttons, which could just as easily be interpreted as basic drawn shapes rather than app interface pieces.",
                "Shortly before this teaser project, I had created a simple Lottie loader animation featuring the logo. It was visually catchy, so opening the video with it felt natural. When I compared it with my free-writing notes—movement, pickup, speed, dropping, location, and more—it aligned perfectly with the themes I wanted to express."
